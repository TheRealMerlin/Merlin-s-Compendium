# Merlin's Compendium

This is a collection of various topics I've learned throughout my undergraduate physics degree. It is still in its early stages with the table of contents as a basic overview of what to expect.

***Note that the sections in the chapters are subject to change to better describe the material, but it is unlikely any more changes to the chapters will occur (with the exception of added appendixes with relevant mathematics).***

I plan on continuing adding content to the compendium and I will also add in comments in the code for others to understand how I format the compendium. Hopefully others can use this as a reference and even add in topics that they find relevant.
